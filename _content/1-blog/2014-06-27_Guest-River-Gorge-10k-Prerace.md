excerpt: '<p> My first 10k race of the year is coming up on the 28th.  I have some mixed feelings about this one.  One one hand, I'm very excited since it is a trail race.  I haven't done a trail race in years.  I'm also pretty nervous because of the same reason, plus this has a rough steady incline the last half as you can see in the map above. </p>'

<p> My first 10k race of the year is coming up on the 28th.  I have some mixed feelings about this one.  One one hand, I'm very excited since it is a trail race.  I haven't done a trail race in years.  I'm also pretty nervous because of the same reason, plus this has a rough steady incline the last half as you can see in the map above. </p>

<p><h3>Race Strategy</h3></p>

<p>To be quite honest, there's not going to be much strategy here.  I haven't run a hard run of this distance in quite a while.  Probably the 8k I did out in Hampton was the last run of close to this distance done at a hard effort.  I figure that with the overall downhill slope in the first half of this race, I can probably do a sub 7 for each of those splits, and try to hold on for the last half at a 7 minute pace or slightly faster.  Again, this may change the day of the race.  I tend to have a habit or going out fast with adrenaline making the last mile or two excruciating.  Regardless of how fast or slow I go out, I will at least have some beautiful scenery. </p>

<p><h3>River Gorge Scenery</h3></p>

<p>Among all of the runners in the area, if they have run at the river gorge, they only have wonderful things to say about it.  With the morning being a bit cooler, I'm hoping it helps make my run that much more enjoyable. </p>

<p>Above are some of the thumbnails of cool pictures that were posted online of the trail.  I'm hoping to get a few pictures myself on Saturday.  I'll also put results up of how I did.  Regardless of how I do, I think I'll at least have fun. </p>
