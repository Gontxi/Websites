  <p> The days are getting longer, hotter, and it's harder to find the gumption to get up and running.  Sometimes I'll stumble across a new form of motivation.  Unfortunately, this time of the year that's a very hard thing to find.  With a marathon coming up, it's easier to get going, but I am not a huge fan of running for over an hour at a time.  So, I find myself thinking, "How can I enjoy running very long miles, and doing it in the heat?"  Well, should I try running with music again? </p>

<p> The days are getting longer, hotter, and it's harder to find the gumption to get up and running.  Sometimes I'll stumble across a new form of motivation.  Unfortunately, this time of the year that's a very hard thing to find.  With a marathon coming up, it's easier to get going, but I am not a huge fan of running for over an hour at a time.  So, I find myself thinking, "How can I enjoy running very long miles, and doing it in the heat?"  Well, should I try running with music again? </p>

<p><h3>No Tunes?</h3></p>

<p>As long as I have been running, probably 80% of the time I have no music on during a workout.  Normally, I enjoy hearing the sound of me breathing, my feet on the ground, and any sound that nature presents me with.  Also, around here, there are many cars on the road, dogs barking at me, and the occasional "neighborly hello."  <br /><br />

One of the best things about running without headphones is hearing the sound of the river.  Call me weird, but hearing and seeing water flowing has a strange relaxing effect on me, especially in the heat.  I've been known to jump into creeks and rivers to cool off during a run back in high school and college.  Every time I did that, it felt awesome!  The only regret I have about jumping into water to cool off is having soggy shoes for the rest of the run.  I figure it's a small price to pay, and was always kind of fun.<br /><br />

The other part I would miss if I had headphones on is the wildlife I have around here at certain stretches.  Nearly every day I run, I can hear an animal in the woods.  I've seen deer, squirrels, possums, and one day a beautiful fox.  I wish I had a camera to get a picture of the fox.  He was actually getting a drink from the creek when he heard me dragging myself around a curve.  I heard a couple of splashes, looked over, and saw him hurring across to the other side of the creek.  He then turned around, looked at me a minute, and kept on going.  If I had headphones on that day, I never would have seen him.<br /><br />

I know there are some running purists out there that say, "Headphones are the Devil!"  To be quite honest, they aren't necessarily wrong, and they aren't necessarily right either.  I think that sometimes, a person needs some extra motivation to run, especially running hard. </p>

<p><h3>Play That Funky Music!</h3></p>

<p>So I may not have run with headphones as much as other people, but that doesn't mean I never do.  To be honest, on a long day, I enjoy running with music - It breaks up the monotony.  However, I tend to spend a great deal of time every couple of months trying to find new running tunes to try out.  After a while it can become time consuming.  So, I'm going to try out a new method of finding music today:  <a href="http://www.runhundred.com">Run Hundred.</a>  The person in charge of this site, actually tallies up votes from people trying these songs, and then lists the favorite running songs each month!  The worst case scenario is that I'll hate all the songs for a month, and keep my old tracks.  I figure if there is a good song or two on there, I can put those songs in for my running list for a time.  With the ramping mileage, I know I'll be needing some new tunes.  <br /><br />

It appears that the songs currently for this month have a lower BPM (beats per minute), so some of them could definitely be beneficial to my long runs when I need to go slower anyways.  With my normal playlists, they really get my blood going and I tend to run a wee-bit faster than I should.  <br /><br />

<a href="http://www.runhundred.com">Run Hundred</a> seems to be really easy to use.  I literally typed in my email address to sign up for the newsletter that will contain a link to the top 10 running songs for that month.  If I really don't want to use it anymore, I can just unsubscribe from the mailing list and be done with it. </p>

<p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3></p>
<p>
I think that I will have to start running with music at least 2 times a week from here on out, at least until the marathon in November.  I know that my usual area of running might be a little dangerous for music, so for my long runs I'll need to go elsewhere to be a little safer.  I really don't think I'll use headphones for my big race, but I may change my mind when it gets a little closer to show-time.  So far I've run with music 2 times in a race: a 5k, and a half-marathon.  The 5k worked pretty well, the half-marathon - not so much.  I actually turned off my music a little past 6 miles in.  I needed to concentrate on all those hills! <br /><br />

Speed workouts are going to be a trick I think.  With it being hot, it's harder to get a good pace going.  I feel that the music may help distract from the faster, harder speeds and with the heat.  I am concerned that the music would push me a little bit to hard for a speed workout.  It hasn't yet, but it may be smarter to err on the side of safety.</p>
