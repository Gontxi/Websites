summary: '<p>The time is nearly here to start my official marathon workouts. I have one, maybe two weeks left to prepare my body for the workouts involved. After considering the amount of time I have, the way my body works with mileage vs speed, Iâ€™ve decided to try the <a href="http://www.hansons-running.com/training-plans/advanced-training-plan/">Hanson Marathon Plan.</a></p>'

<p>If you're unsure of what the Hanson Marathon Method is, check out this <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/race-training/marathoning-hansons-way">Runner's World</a> link for more information on it.</p>

<p>The first link I put in is similar to the actual workouts I'll be doing 2 weeks from now.  I'll post each workout week on here before I do them, and then after the week is over, I'll put up my thoughts as well.  </p>

<p>I went with the Hanson plan because it seems to focus on my main weak area - running on tired legs.  I've never really had an issue with speed workouts, but after I get to a certain mileage - I feel very sluggish.  This plan teaches my body how to deal and run on tired legs.  The mileage it has is also a very big plus with my busy lifestyle.  Here's what I plan to do this week - to lead into Hanson. </p>

<p>The table above has my current plan as of now.  I'm hoping I'm able to do all of it.  I know a few weeks ago, my speed workout and tempo workouts would have been perfect.  I'll have to see how I do with effort and HR.  I figure I may have to decrease these a little bit to deal with the summer heat.  Depending on how I feel Sunday, depends on if I'll modify the distance of the long run.  I just realized I had a race this saturday.  I was off a week on my internal clock.</p>
<p>I'm actually pretty excited to try out the Hanson Marathon Method.  I have heard of it, and understand its basic principles, but I feel that as I'm doing this training I need to know more.  So, I went ahead and bought their book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/1934030856/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1934030856&linkCode=am2&tag=perdotnet-20&linkId=3HR5KAPWG3XXZURF">Hansons Marathon Method: A Renegade Path to Your Fastest Marathon</a>. I am certain to be learning many crucial elements while reading this book - including diet tips.</p>
<p> Well, wish me luck on this week's training!  </p>
