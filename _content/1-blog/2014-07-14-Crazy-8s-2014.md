summary: That time of year came and went again, it seems to come around quicker and quicker these days.  The Crazy 8s is by far the biggest race that we have in this area.  People from all over the US come and try it out each year.  It used to have the world record for the fastest 8k, until someone up in Boston, MA actually beat it out by exactly 1 second.  The people that put on this race were hoping to bring back the male record to our area.  Unfortunately, that did not happen this year.  We were off by around 20 seconds or so.  If Mother Nature were more cooperative about being a little cooler and not as humid, we may have had a chance.  Nontheless, it was still a great race.

<p><h3>New Things</h3></p>

<p>This year, my wife decided she'd give the race a shot.  She really wanted to try it out since she'd never run a night race, nor an 8k.  We already had a jogging stroller - thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/hamptonrunner">@hamptonrunner</a> - and we also had a baby we could put in it this year!  My wife decided pretty early on that she was going to be racing with our newest family addition.  She trained up the best she was able to, and gave it her best effort.  To be quite honest, I was pretty impressed with her time based on the amount of running she was able to actually do, and she was pushing a jogging stroller.  She came across in just a little over an hour (1:00:10), and there weren't many strollers that finished ahead of her.  For her training being decent one week, and non-existent the next week, she did awesome.  I can only imagine what she could have done if she did 20 miles a week consistently for a couple of months.  I think my daughter got worn out during this race as well, it was a toughy! </p>

<p>I also saw a couple of my former students at this race.  They decided to run cross country their senior year in high school, and looked forward to this race all year.  They really looked like the enjoyed the race.  It was a welcome sight to see them still running on occasion, and one of them ran around 46 minutes.  Not too shabby for never doing an 8k and running once every 2 weeks!

<p><h3>Actual Race</h3></p>

<p>I know that I'm not an elite, and will never be an elite.  This race is always more about the fun of running and the experience of it.  If I wasn't in the age group as the runners going for the world record, I may have a small shot at getting an age group medal.  Since it doesn't look good for me, I decided to not go all out during this race.  I treated it as a threshold, or really hard tempo.  I knew I'd beat my last year's time, and that's what really mattered to me the most.  I knew I wasn't going to be running a 32:30 today if I went all out as it was very hot and humid.  My 32:30 was run in the chilly rain - an environment in which I always run better.  </p>

<p>When the gun went off, it's always tough to get going.  There's so many people, that I go to the outside, and keep passing people until about 400-500m into the race.  After that I really just "find the zone."  I was very comfortable in my first mile, and came across at 6:30.  I thought that was awesome, but I needed to keep a constant effort, and the hills are coming soon - so a drop in pace would be expected. </p>

<p>Going into the second mile, I passed the awesome stroller guy in our area.  He would probably decimate me in a race if he didn't push the jogging stroller.  He's like 43, and a really nice guy.  He usually ends up finishing behind me in every race by about 30 seconds, so depending on my effort and his placement would be a great factor of my fitness.  Mile 2 came and went pretty quick, and I ran a 6:45 split.  Quite a bit slower from the first mile, but that was to be expected running an equal effort race with hills.</p>

<p>Going into mile 3, I knew it was going to be the hardest 2 miles.  At 2.5 miles in, there is a constant grade hill that lasts until about 3.5 miles in.  I saw the other Keith right in front of me.  He beat me by about a minute in the last race I did, and I was going all out then.  I realized, if I pushed, I could probably beat him in this race and that'd be awesome.  I decided against pushing to hard with a long run the next day and kept my threshold/sometimes tempo effort on the hill.  We passed each other back and forth quite a bit.  He was running with another guy and was trying to help him out.  He knew that the last mile was easy, and coached the other guy into saving up and going all out the last mile.  My mile 3 split was in at 7:02 - not horrible. </p>

<p>I was in the middle of the steep part of the hill and knew this was my slowest split.  Every year I'd run, it was the slowest.  Suprisingly, no one actually passed me here, but I passed several runners.  I saw forms changing for the worse, and many were complaining about this hill.  They were asking others when it ended.  I smiled a bit since I had experience running here, and knew when it ended.  I kept my form up this hill this year, it made me proud.  The hill ended, and it leveled out.  If I was going for an all out race, I'd have made my move here - the same thing a few others around me did.  I held the effort and finished mile 4 in a slower-that-hoped 7:15.  </p>

<p>The last mile was a bit easier.  There's a good downhill in it to recover, and only one hill at the end.  Maintaining effort here was actually very easy, and I passed many more people.  I guess that hill from the last mile really wiped out some people.  I decided that I'd give a good effort the last half of a mile with the large crowds, and with the finish being inside of a stadium that makes you feel like you're in the Olympics - it couldn't hurt.  Going up my last little hill, I sped up my pace slightly and passed the last 2 runners I thought I'd pass.  At the top of the hill I entered the stadium.  At the 10 yard line, those two people decided to kick and pass me.  I thought about it for a minute and decided to just sprint the last 50 yards as hard as I could.  I blew past them, and about 3-4 other people as well - one being a pacer.  I finished my last mile split in 6:47 which wasn't bad.  My watch had me at 5.01 miles in 34:24.  I beat my time of last year by over a minute, and I didn't run it nearly as hard.  My last 800m got my HR up really high, but I finished the race feeling I could have run faster.  I also beat the awesome stroller guy by a pretty good margin.  The other Keith, beat me by about the same amount of time he did in the 10k.  He really went all out in that last mile. </p>

<p><h3>After the Race</h3></p>

<p>I was happy with my results, as was my wife.  She wanted to break one hour, but she got very close.  She wants to try to run more if she's able to.  Many people in the area were very impressed she was able to run at all.  She's looking into racing a 5k in the next couple of months.  As for me, I won't be able to race to often with this marathon training being my top priority.  I figure I'll do 1 race per month, with the next race I go all out in being a half marathon in September.  I'll know in that race if I can hit my marathon goal, or if I'm being a little bit ambitious.
