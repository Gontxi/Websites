  	After running my half marathon in Bristol back in April, I feel like I've only been getting slower.  I'm trying to figure out why exactly that is.  After re-thinking the last few months, here's a couple of reasons why I have slowed down:  Season change, Diet, Less Mileage, Time Constraints.

	The good news is that I'm pretty certain I'll be ready for the big race in november.

<h3>Season Change</h3>
</p>
<p>
I'm fairly certain that this is my number one cause of the running slowdown.  I remember back in the golden years that I would always be much slower in the summer and then all of a sudden have a huge speed increase in the fall.  This was greatly attributed to the weather I think.  Plus, it's really hard to go from running 6:30-6:45 miles for a couple miles to running an 8:00 mile at the same effort.  Some of the slow down is from a couple of the other reasons as listed above, but here's some information I found on the Internet that seems pretty consistent.

Just looking at the numbers above make me feel a little bit better.

<p>
<h3>Diet</h3>
</p>
<p>
I know my diet hasn't been the greatest for the past 2 months, but I can't really help it.  As I start to increase my mileage my diet should follow suit as well.  It always has in the past.  

When I run, and the outside of my calves start to hurt or cramp up, I realize that I've been taking in way too much sugar.  Also, when I feel sluggish from the get-go I also know I need a diet change (not counting hot weather).

<h3>Decrease in Mileage / Time Constraints </h3>
</p>
<p>
These last two go hand-in-hand.  As the school year was winding down, and the kids are starting to do more extracurricular activities, it makes it harder to find time to run.  This has lead to a decrease in my regular running mileage.  Soon I should be back up to 20-25 miles a week and going up from there.

I just need to keep in mind that everything will fall back into place and not worry so much about my times being slow at the current moment.
