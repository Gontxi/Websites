  <p> One of my biggest weaknesses when it comes to running is the lack of strength training.  To be honest, even in high school and college I never really cared for it very much.  When I had a coach, it was always something I made sure to do.  I grumbled a bit about it, but I always did what my coach set before me.  Was it fear of him finding out I was slacking?  It's very hard to say, but eventually it became part of the pre-workout ritual.  To be honest, I did notice a difference with my running when I was doing my required exercises.  </p>

<p> One of my biggest weaknesses when it comes to running is the lack of strength training.  To be honest, even in high school and college I never really cared for it very much.  When I had a coach, it was always something I made sure to do.  I grumbled a bit about it, but I always did what my coach set before me.  Was it fear of him finding out I was slacking?  It's very hard to say, but eventually it became part of the pre-workout ritual.  To be honest, I did notice a difference with my running when I was doing my required exercises.  </p>

<p><h3>High School</h3></p>

<p>In high school.... Well, let's be realistic.  There wasn't much strength training other than situps, and some stretching.  At the time I didn't know a whole lot about running, but this stuff was still a pain to do.  I was ready to run, and this stuff always got in the way.  The situps weren't necessarily difficult, just tedious.  Before every run I was required to do 100 situps, followed up by stretching - static only.  I was told that the situps help with my breathing during my run, while my stretching increased my flexibility.  To me it made sense.  I didn't know if it was a placebo effect on me, or if there really was something, but it did seem easier to run. I still hated the pre-run ritual. </p>

<p><h3>College Days</h3></p>

<p>College is where I actually learned quite a bit.  Heck, my first day I learned all about my training methods in high school being pretty ridiculous.  I went from running 3 miles as hard as I could in racing flats, to running 10 miles in shoes with a bit of padding in them.  I fell flat on my face after my coach said 10 miles today.  I then realized, the 10 miles were at a much easier pace, and that it wasn't as bad as I thought.  I also learned to incorporate dynamic stretching, as well as the dreaded 5am weightroom with 30 minute jogs.  Man did I hate those 5am practices.  We did a couple of the same things we did in high school, but the whole weight room idea was insane at first.  Then my coach explained to me that light reps will help build your strength, and how important it is for your body to be strong to help your body keep its form longer, and move easier.  We were never meant to bulk up, just add in some resistance.  Again, it was tedious, but necessary.  Soon after the new training methods, and strength training, I was actually running faster than I ever had before, and longer to boot!  At the end of my college career I had learned how important strength training truly is, especially for a runner.  <br /><br />

Then I fast foward to today....</p>

<p><h3>Old...er Age</h3></p>

<p> I've been running again for a year now after about a 7 year hiatus.  I realize that I'll never be as fast as I once was, and decided that because of that fact, there's no point in really doing any strength training.  Well, it just so happens I have this crazy uncle, <a href="https://twitter.com/hamptonrunner">@hamptonrunner</a>, that somehow sweet-talked me into a marathon.  Since I've only raced the maximum distance of a lowly 13.1 mile race, and nearly died from it, I figured I needed to begin strength training again.  Even though I hate this aspect of running, I do know that strength training is very benefial to overall health, and running at any distance.  <br /><br />

I think that my wife actually knew this as well, and has actually started us on babysteps for strength training.  For now, it's just core-ab excercises, but they are going to be vital very soon.  We are actually on day 3 on an app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/runtastic-six-pack-abs-trainer/id685857245?mt=8">Six-Pack Abs</a>.  I saw the numbers we started out at.  HA!  A measly 3 reps of 8 in 3 different exercises.  Well, it just so happens, I used to be able to pump out 80 sit ups in a minute!  So, day 1 - I feel the burn after 4 crunches - ouch.  I suck.  Well, I think that now I really know how out of shape I am in different aspects even though I am able to run for 10 miles.  After this app becomes easy, my wife and I may try a new app with new suprises.  After all, if I'm not ready for my marathon in November in all areas, I'll end up hitting the wall and falling way short of my goal.<br /><br />

Tomorrow - Day 4 - 3 sets of 12, I'm feeling the burn already. </p>
