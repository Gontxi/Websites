summary: It's been 8 years since I've been able to look forward to another fall XC season.  This year it's extra exciting since I get to coach the boys' and girls' teams at a local high school.  I think it's ironic that I am coaching a high school that is just down the road from my Alma Mater, but that's ok.  Even though I have been involved in running at one level or another for several years, coaching a group of kids has put quite a different perspective on things for me.  For one, I didn't realize all of the things I took for granted from my previous coaches - including finding courses to run, and the amount of work needed to schedule a training plan for all of the runners.

### Nowhere to Run?
After running through my own high school and college, I realized that I personally knew of dozens of courses to train on.  Each course has its own strengths and even has core focus to it.  I had flat courses, hilly trails, shady trails, sunny paths, road courses, long run routes, and any combination of these.  The only problem was none of them were close to the school I am now coaching.  Crap...

So the day after I am told I have the head coach position, I start looking at the courses the runners have used in the past.  Other than their home course they run for open and invitational meets - nearly everything is on the road.  Not good!  I began trying to check out different roads and mapping some interesting routes close to the school through [Mapmyrun.](http://www.mapmyrun.com)  Turns out that nearly everything is pavement, with a bit of dirt roads.  I've run a vast majority of these, and driven them in the past few weeks to see if they might be a decent course to train on.  Some have potential, if I am able to keep the kids injury-free that is.  So far I have discovered:

* A 4 mile hilly loop (Road and dirt)
* A 6 mile loop with a giant hill (Road)
* A 3 mile out and back with a nice creek in the middle (Trail)
* A 4-8 mile out and back (Road and dirt)
* Good hills for hill repeat days (Dirt, Gravel, and Pavement)
* A few variations to these main courses

To be honest, our cross country team should be known as the "pavement pounders" after this season.  With school nearly started, I figured it was time to cross my fingers and pray that I had kids interested in running this fall.

### Running is for the "Crazies"
Going into the first practice I was hoping to have at least one kid show up in decent shape from running over the summer.  I remember back in my high school days that basically no one actually did any form of running during their break.  I know that many successful programs have dedicated, talented kids that run year-round and even have feeder schools to get runners started young.  The high school I went to, and the one I am coaching at doesn't really have these kinds of resources.  It's a very small pool to grab from, and any interested runner basically is guaranteed a varsity slot no matter what speed they are.  So, I hoped for just one runner to be entering the season in good shape.

At the first practice, I had a decent number of kids turn out, and one actually did run over the summer.  Most of the girls seemed to be in shape for about a 30-33 minute 5k, and the boys were ranging from about a 20 minute 5k, to nearly a 30 minute 5k.  The good news is that if I play my cards right, all runners should see significant improvement at the end of the season.  The bad news is that after talking to them, they didn't get many miles in last season - about 10 per week, if that.

I figure that I needed to get these kids up to 25+ miles per week by the end of the season if possible and starting them off at 12-14 miles a week.  I think that at first all of the kids were in shock about having to run for a constant 25-30 minutes on the first day.  I kept telling them that we will eventually reach a goal of "not walking", then we'd move up from there.  A huge suprise to them was me running in practice with them.  I don't think they have ever seen a coach run with the team.  I may be wrong, but I think it will definitely help things more than hurt.

### Who's This Old Guy?
During the different easy days we have been doing (a lot lately to base build), I've been trying to run with each person in-turn.  I feel it's important to get to know each runner and their expectations and goals.  I am also able to see their running form, listen to their breathing, and see how strong-willed each individual is among some other things.  Some of the runners seem to think it's awesome I run with them, others haven't said quite yet.  

So far from jogging along with the team I've noticed several things:  Nearly every runner is a heel-striker, each runner despises hills, and all but one isn't able to run for more than 10 minutes without walking.  So far though, each runner does have a realistic goal for this season, so I will do my best to coach them into achieving their goals.

The other thing that all of my runners are doing: racing every run.  I remember doing this in high school, and apparently nothing has changed over those years.  I've been trying to teach each runner that not every practice is run at an all out pace.  In reality - few are.  What makes it tricky is that none have the endurance yet to hold even an easy pace for very long, except for one boy.  In a month or two, I hope they have at least two paces down: race pace and easy pace.  As far as I could tell, none of the runners knew there were different paces.  Just wait until they see what track intervals, long runs, tempos, fartleks, and hill repeats are!

### It's Just A Flesh Wound
The season has barely started, and a couple nagging injuries have already popped up.  So far nothing serious, but some of the main causes of injury I've seen are: shoes, heel striking, lack of strength training.

Every runner is wearing the shoes they had last year, and most are wearing them to school all day - not good.  After looking at the shoes, I can see huge wear areas, and the padding is virtually gone.  With all of the roads we have, this is probably a very large problem.  I've spoken to each runner about the importance of their shoes, the proper type of running shoes, and how often they need to be changed.  I've also drilled down that they do not wear the shoes to walk around in.  Once everyone's shoes are in, I'm hoping we will be ok in the shoe department for the season.

Some runners are heel-striking worse than others.  I know this is an area of debate among runners.  I am one that believes you shouldn't mess with a running form very much.  If it looks like their style may hurt them, adjust the form slowly.  That being said, I have one or two runners that seem to be slamming their heel into the ground and hitting the brakes with each stride.  These runners have to learn to change their landing slightly, or it's going to be a long season.  Some of the other heel-strikers have more of a rolling effect or a very small heel-first strike.  I'm not so concerned with them.  It's best to deal with the biggest problems first, especially before any bad habits form.  The only other real poor running form problem I have is with one girl.  She runs like "Pop-eye" swinging her arms way to the side with each step.  Yes, she even makes fists as she runs.  Even though it may intimidate other runners to get out of her way, it will help keep her healthy if she can relax a bit and learn a forward to back motion with her arms.

The other big area of weakness - strength training.  I personally have been a bit lazy in this department as well.  Coaching has actually forced me to create a routine for the runners to increase their strength all over their body.  I think in a month, each runner will notice a difference their running gets from our routine.

### Wrap It Up
I won't lie.  This first season will be quite the learning experience for both me and my runners.  I know that we may not accomplish much this season, but I am hoping to keep working with my boys and girls throughout the year.  I figure that if they do what I ask in the winter, and after track season is over, we might have competitive teams the next year.  The wonderful thing about a young team is everyone gets to come back stronger the following year.  

Our conference has some very strong runners, including last year's state XC champion.  I know that I won't have any runners able to compete with him this year, and I may not for very many years.  The important thing is that these kids are able to learn something from me that they can take with them throughout their lifetime.  They can learn to improve their own times, challenge themselves, and beat their greatest rival - themself.  So far I've enjoyed watching these kids learn and improve in the short time I've been with them.  I just hope it can carry over for years to come.
