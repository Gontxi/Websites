So far, I have found a couple of issues with it, although I have been able to solve them.  I really wish that Garmin had fixed the issues I'd run into before releasing this watch.

	I ended up getting a brand new Garmin 620 at the beginning of this year (2014).  The watch itself is pretty incredible, yet buggy at times.  So far, I have found a couple of issues with it, although I have been able to solve them.  I really wish that Garmin had fixed the issues I'd run into before releasing this watch.

	<h3>Watch Wont Charge</h3>
</p>
<p>
	I won't lie, this issue scared the life out of me.  If I wasn't as big into technology as I am, I may never have figured this problem out.  I was down to 5% battery, and even connected to every power source imaginable, (different usb ports, and wall outlets with a usb converter) yet I was unable to do anything except slowly lose my charge.  Eventually, the watch turned off to conserve power.  Upon trying to reboot it, I got into a really cool diagnostic boot.  A person could really change some things through that menu.  Anyways, my problem was solved by performing a master reset on the watch.  The problem - I lost all of my data on the watch, including my VO2 numbers.  Here's how I performed the master reset on the watch to make it feel better:

	1) Power off the watch (if it isn't already off)
	2) Press and hold the Start/Stop and Lap/Reset buttons
	3) Press and hold Light (three buttons should be pressed in)
	4) After the first beep release Start/Stop
	5) After the second beep, release Lap/Reset
	6) Release Light

	After these steps were performed, I had to re-do the setup wizard, and get a gps signal like I did when the watch was brand new.  

	I wasn't happy I had to perform this at the time, but it beats having to retire a super expensive watch after 3 months of running.

	<h3>Wifi Issues</h3>
</p>
<p>
	After I had to perform the previous steps, I ran into a problem of reconfiguring my wireless networks on my watch.  Usually I would run with my phone, and my runs sync up that way.  However, after a few weeks of doing this, I was getting a little flustered, so I set out to fix my problem.  It would appear that I was doing 2 things incorrectly.

	First, I am on a Mac.  Secondly, I'm trying to use the software that Garmin says to use. 

	After doing a ton of research, I found the two methods of solving this problem.  Suprisingly, they are both pretty simple:

	Option 1)  Use a Windows computer.  The software you need according to Garmin doesn't save the settings to the watch if you're on a Mac.  I have no idea why this is, but it definitely works if you use the Windows version of software.

	Option 2)  Download a different program.  It turns out that Garmin has us Mac users download <u>Garmin Express</u>.  This software has everything we needed, and it looks like it would work - but it doesn't.  What I had to get was a piece of software called <u>Garmin Express Fit</u>.  This software is a little more basic, but it fixed the wifi connection problem I was having.  As soon as I disconnected my watch, it told me I had a new wireless network!

	<h3>Other Issues</h3>
</p>
<p>
	You can look on the Garmin forums for yourself.  This watch is notorious for bugs.  Some of the big ones I've read about are these:

	1) GPS signal being awful.  I've not had this personally, maybe I'm lucky?
	2) Wifi Network error.  This isn't the same as the wifi issue I had.  Apparently, you need to have your wifi under channel 11.  Also, it needs to be mixed mode if you have a G router.  N-only is a no-go.

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
</p>
<p>
	I love this watch!  It's given me more in a running watch than I thought would ever be possible.  The dynamics it gives are excellent.  The VO2 max is fairly accurate (my own opinion), and I can share my runs live with people I want.  This is handy if I'm running somewhere and I want my wife to know where I am.  I just hope that some of the bugs that still plague this watch get fixed sometime soon!
