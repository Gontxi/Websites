<p>Over the past weekend, I had my first 10K race this year.  Some of the race experience was expected, some of it wasn't.  Overall I did well, but I hope to be able to run a little faster soon.  Here is what I liked and disliked about the race.</p>

<p><h3>Getting There</h3></p>

<p>I have to admit, finding the location of this race was no picnic.  I tried a couple days before to use Google Maps to find the location of the park.  For some reason, Google kept taking me out to the middle of nowhere.  I had to keep comparing different maps and using a variety of sites to compare and get directions.  Eventually, I found instructions that I felt would lead me to the park.  In summary, the directions would be - Get to Coeburn, head south on Dungannon road for a few miles, then make a left into the park. </p>

<p>On my way to the park, I thought I was going to get lost.  I kept trying to get to Dungannon Rd, and my GPS was taking me all over these back roads.  Eventually I found the road, and some handy signs that said 10K with an arrow.  Upon finding the road to the park, I was a bit nervous about my run.  I drove what felt like 2 miles into the park, and down some very serious hills.  I thought that if there are any hills like this in the race, I'll be doing well to just finish. </p>

<p><h3>Race Environment</h3></p>

<p>As I parked my car, I looked around and noticed it was very foggy, and there was hardly any parking places remaining.  I knew at that point there was a pretty good turnout for an inaugural race.  I headed down to the registration booth to pick up my packet.  As I went down a hill, and some stairs, I could actually hear water.  This was going to be a fun little race.  My packet had all of the usual goodies inside of it - A plastic cup, keyring, brochures, even a 2-week free trial gym membership.  The shirt was a cool green with a picture of a train.  I thought it was fitting since we were actually running on the old railway bed.  <p>

<p>I kept looking around to find some familiar faces, and I found very few.  I found the guy I knew that would win the race, and a handful of others.  Eventually, it was time to get a quick look at the trail. </p>

<p>As far as I trotted, this was the footing, and a majority of the scenery.  The footing reminded me very much of a trail I would run in high school.  We referred to it as the Caylor Trail.  For my warmup - I jogged a total of a mile.  In the 800m out, I ran through a tunnel, and a cool wooden bridge over the river.  What was funny I thought, was the point I came out of the old train tunnel.  There was a photographer, and another lady there, and they got up really quick thinking the race had already started.  I told them the race hadn't started yet, and they seemed to laugh.  They said they should have looked at the time since there was still a bit before the race started. </p>

<p>On the trot back, I noticed a slight incline.  I noted to myself that when I hit the bridge, I had half a mile left and I could try to start a kick from there if I needed to.</p>

<p><h3>Race Time</h3></p>

<p>I positioned myself toward the front and on the right outside.  I figured I'd need to go around some people at the start as always.  Turns out I was right.  The gun went off, and everyone started out.  The first 400M there was a 13 year old kid that took off flying as fast as he could.  I looked at my watch and saw a 6:45 pace and I knew he was going to fizzle quickly.  I guess everyone goes through that stage in racing.  About the time I went through the train tunnel and crossed the bridge, the race had settled in.  I was in 4th place, and not much changed from that point on.  I know that at the half mile mark, my legs felt sluggish and I was hoping to be able to keep going at a decent pace.  </p>

<p>I kept trying to keep a "tempo-ish" feel for the way out since it was downhill, and I'd need every bit of energy for the way back.  Turns out I guessed correctly.  I grabbed some water at the 3 mile mark, and got ready for the dreaded turn.  I immediately knew this sucked.  I decided that my watch was inaccurate at this point for pace, and I decided to keep the 2 guys in front of me at the same distance and keep the same effort.  At points they would pull ahead, and other times I would be gaining on them, so I felt like I did what I set out to do. </p>

<p>By mile 5 - I hated life.  I'm pretty sure everyone else in the race did as well.  One of the two guys in front of me had decided to kick for the last mile, I knew I couldn't.  The other guy had lost his form, but was about a minute ahead of me.  I decided to try to speed up a little and see if I could catch him. When I passed the bridge, I knew I wasn't going to pass him, but I could gain a little bit of time, so I sped up more for the last half mile.  I eventually caught glimpse of the finish line and it had just hit 42 minutes and 50 seconds.  I was relieved to know I was going to really break my goal of 45 minutes on the course.  I crossed the line about 15 seconds after the guy in front of me, and finished in 4th place overall with a 43:21.  It felt good to be done with that race. </p>

<p><h3>After the race</h3></p>

<p>Waiting around for the rest of the finishers, I thought I'd get my walking cooldown in and talk to some of the other finishers.  The guy that won is a 55 year old that can do 1:24 half marathon times.  He ran this course in 39:41.  I asked him how he held on for the last half, and he laughed.  He said he went out fast and was trying to just hold on for the hills.  He must have, he ran a good time.</p>

<p>I also ran into another guy that knew who I was, but I wasn't sure on who he was.  Turns out he's a very new runner.  He ran in the Steven Rowlett race with me last year, and then he did a 5k in Harlan, KY.  He said after the Harlan race, he was hooked.  He seems like he was, he'd done lots of homework and seemed to be knowledgeable on many aspects.  One thing I was proud of is he wasn't afraid to change his shoes.  He was fitted for some shoes by a person, and they had an absolute huge heel.  He tried going from a very minimalist approach, to those shoes that he said felt like anchors.  He started experiencing hip pain, and shin splints.  He immediately stopped using those those, and the pain went away.  Many beginners may try to run through the pain, and cause more issues down the road.  I was glad to see him make a switch to a pair of shoes that better suited him.  </p>

<p>As you can see from the picture at the top of the article, I did get first place in my age group.  I was very impressed with the quality of these medals.  The guy I had talked to even got 3rd place in our age group.  Turns out he's 26.  </p>

<p><h3>Conclusion</h3></p>

<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this race.  The people were friendly, the trail was impossible to get lost on, the trail footing was great.  The only thing I hated was the out and back part - mostly the mountain.  The prizes and food they had available were great as well.  To be honest, it felt like a race that had been around for several years.  I'll definitely be back next year.</p>

<p>As for the time I ran, it was less than a minute off of the 10K I did last fall.  That course was much easier as well.  I thought going into this race that I had lost some time from the fall and spring.  After seeing my finish time paired with the difficulty of this race, I may not be far off from what I was wanting at all - especially with semi-tired legs during the race.  I guess for now I have to focus on my <a href={{home}}/blog/Decided-On-Hanson-Training-Method>marathon training</a>, and the upcoming <a href="http://werunevents.com/crazy-8s/">Crazy 8's</a>.</p>
