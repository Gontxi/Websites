summary: Part of what makes running difficult is being able to find the time to run.  Some days you're just exhausted after a full day's work, or you've been at home with your kids all day and you just want to relax.  Sometimes, you have to travel great distances in a car and after you reach your destination, you're given out.  You don't feel like running at all.  That was me a couple of weeks ago.

<p>Back in November, Dad's siblings came in to visit to show Dad their respects after his sudden passing.  He was the youngest of five children.  As we were all eating dinner his family had talked about the very few times that the entire family had gotten together.  Everyone realized sadly that it was only during funerals.  </p>

<p>We decided that if we didn't start seeing each other more often, we would never get to catch up with one another except in times of sadness.  So, Dad's siblings decided to start a yearly family reunion where everyone could get together.  We starting discussing dates, and locations that would be best to have the reunion.  Eventually, everyone settled on a small town in Pennsylvania during the 4th of July weekend.  It sounded good at the time, but as it approached, I began to dread the 9 hour trip with 3 small kids - one being a baby. </p>

<p><h3>The Trip</h3></p>

<p>We left the house at 6am on Friday, and Mom had decided to ride with us.  I had seriously considered buying soundproof headphones for our baby meltdowns on the trip.  Fortunately, I didn't need them. </p>

<p> I kept wondering to myself if I had brought all of my running gear, and when on Earth I'd find any time to run.  I didn't even have a course laid out for myself.  Good preparation Keith!  By the time we were halfway into the trip, the ride was actually going very smoothly.  The kids were wonderful, the baby was awesome, and I decided I'd just run the roads where we were staying if nothing else.  I couldn't find my headlamp for night running, but there would be a nice, bright moon.  Now if I could just find the energy for my 2 easy runs! </p>

<p>We were only 30 minutes out from our destination, and the baby started to get a little antsy.  She was a trooper for holding on as long as she did.  We were able to make fantastic time!  As we pulled into the place, it sort of reminded me of a nicer, more populated home.  </p>

<p><h3>The Decision to Run</h3></p>

<p>I unpacked everything, we got dinner arranged, and evening finally fell.  My legs were tired, I was tired, and I really didn't want to run at all.  I had nearly decided to skip my run when I realized this would be an adventure run, and a great opportunity to check out the town.  I had a railroad nearby, a river, and a town full of "Mom and Pop" stores.  An easy run was an excellent choice for today.  It would let me get a feel for the town.  </p>

<p>After I told my wife that I should be back in less than an hour, and then I was off.  My run started at the very edge of town, and crossed over the train tracks.  Turns out that the train station here hasn't been used in 3 years, but it was still neat to look at.  At this time of day, there was really cool air, and it even had a slight breeze.  Perfect running weather.  </p>

<p> I was able to begin running on a sidewalk as soon as I passed the sign that had a message that had "Welcome to the Borough of (someplace)" on it.  To be quite honest I don't know what a "Borough" is, and I still asssume it's a small town?  Anyways, I eventually came to a bridge that crossed over a good sized creek, and I immediately hit the urban area of this "Borough."  For only a half-mile in my run, there was plenty of changing scenery.  Nearly all of the "Mom and Pop" stores were closed due to it being the 4th of July, but it was still really interesting to see.  At the end of mile one, I crossed another bridge, saw a sign that said I was entering a "Township." Whoa!  Nothing looked any different, except there's less buildings around.  I had a local market store to my right, and a dollar store.  That's about it. </p>

<p>Going into my second mile, inside of my "Township," there wasn't much to really see.  Mostly nature and some houses occasionally.  It also had some rolling hills.  At 1.5 miles, there was this really cool ice cream shop to my left.  I knew immediately the family was going to this place.  It was packed!  After this perfectly located dessert shop I had a pretty nice downhill followed up by a sign in the distance.  The sign said "Wecome to the Village of (someplace)" - sorry I can't remember the names of these places.  At this point, the little areas of living were getting a bit ridiculous.  It seems like if there's a single house around, it's in its own zip code.  I hadn't gotten to my turn around of 2.5 miles yet and I've been in 4 different "areas."  Eventually I was able to to turn back around and head back to my own personal "Township."  </p>

<p> On my trek back, I realized the sun was setting and I probably needed to get a picture of the sunset (pictured above).  As I got back to the "urban borough" I realized that I had been so distracted by my surroundings that I hadn't even glanced at my watch one time.  I was running like I had "back in the day."  I took a quick peek and noticed that my pace was faster than I was hoping for, but my HR was much lower than expected.  Awesome! </p>

<p><h3>Thoughts</h3></p>

<p>Even though I had initially dreaded my run, I was relieved that I had completed it.  The run itself was one of the best I'd had in a long time.  I think it was due to the new location, and the picture perfect weather.  It was also an awesome break from being in a van all day.  I think the next time I travel some place, I will definitely go for a little stroll around town.  It really beats the pants off of running the same trails at home.  I guess the next planned trip I have is the <a href="http://www.outerbanksmarathon.com/">OBX Marathon</a>.  I just hope I can enjoy that run as much as I liked my run I had in Pennsylvania. Who knows, maybe by then I'll know what the differences are between a township, villiage, and a borough!</p>
